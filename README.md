# Outcomes 🚀

- This project was made to approach and practice advanced React concepts like reducers and Context API to handle the global state management.

- Chakra UI that builds up the entire application styles.

- Used React performance functions (useCallback, useMemo, memo) to increase performance by preventing components from re-rendering unnecessarily.

- Used `use-context-selector` to increase application performance by selecting the specific pieces of state when using hooks.

- There's an advanced React Hook that handles the integration with the Nominatim API in order to do the geolocalization feature.

- An awesome integration with React Hook Form that handles the forms state management.
